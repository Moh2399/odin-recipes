    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Water as required</li>
        <li>Salt as required</li>
        <li>1 and 1/4 tablespoon whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>Baking soda as required</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the dough
            <p>Sieve both the flours along with baking soda into a bowl. Make some space in the centre and add sugar, salt and 2 tablespoons oil. Heat the water and add it to the flour in batches.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Let the dough rest
            <p>After adding hot water, mix with a spoon and then when the temperature of the water is bearable, knead a smooth and soft dough. Now cover the bowl with a moist cloth and let the dough rest for an hour.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Rolling the dough
            <p>Divide the dough into 8-9 balls and dust the area where you are going to roll them, with flour. Flatten the dough balls as thin as possible and brush the remaining oil on its surface. Start pleating the dough by starting from the top and going all the way to the bottom.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the layer
            <p>Hold one end of the pleated dough and start rolling it into a spiral flat base and once done, press the centre of it. You will get a pleated spiral. Prepare all spiral balls in the same way. Cover these dough balls with a moist cloth and keep them aside for 15 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Make the parotta
            <p>On a dusted surface, roll the spiral balls into a 6-inch circle. Heat the tawa and roast these parottas from both sides by using some oil and make sure that they get cooked evenly. After they are crisp and cooked you will see that the prominent layers have been formed. Now your parottas are ready to be served.</p>
